I Get on stage for the first time
The curtains and the lights are down low
And I know in a couple of hours
It'll be filled with people
I am gonna have to steal the show...
Ooooh...
I waited all my life for this moment,
And now that it is finally here,
In the dying seconds before I go on
I am suddenly struck by fear,
Cause they say that higher up in the air
The bigger the chance you fall,
But then I rather be sorry
For something I tried than to risk never flying at all
Hello world, here I am
Im gonna give it everything I can
And should I fall, I'll just get up again
And keep on trying
Yes if I fall, I'll just get up again
And keep on tryin
The curtain opens and

Whatever happens in the next few minutes
May well define the rest of my life
And I realize this moment's never coming back
So I stop for a second
Stare out the crowd
And make sure that I will never forget
Hello world, here I am
Im gonna give it everything I can
And should I fall, I'll just get up again
And keep on trying
Part of me will never understand how I got up here so high,
But I'm just gonna fly here while I can, not worried by the reasons why
Hello world, here I am...
Hello world, here I am
Im gonna give it everything I can
And should I fall, I'll just get up again
And keep on trying
