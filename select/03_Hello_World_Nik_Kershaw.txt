I thumb the pages one by one
What if a little bit rubs off on me
Soak up the pictures til I'm gone
Dreams for the dreamers, food for fantasy
Yey, I'm hanging by the pool
And I'm looking like a fool
But I don't mind
Easy life

Hello world, looking good
In leopard skin and polished wood
I'd be happy if I could be there with you
Hello world, the trouble is
I've got nothing much to give
But I'd give it all to live within your pages

I make like everything's alright
I live in colour, talk in black and white
Here's the Rembrandt that I bought
Here's the marlin that I caught
Here's the wife looking like my daughter
I don't mind
Easy life

Hello world, looking good
In leopard skin and polished wood
I'd be happy if I could be there with you
Hello world, the trouble is
I've got nothing much to give
But I'd give it all to live within your pages

My glamorous friends, how they dazzle and shine
I can always pretend that it's mine all mine

The clothes I wear are shiny new
They match the three piece and the children too

Hello world
